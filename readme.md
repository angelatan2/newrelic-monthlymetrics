# newrelic-monthlymetrics
Script to gather metrics about how the teams are functioning and how the community is contributing.

1. set your GitHub API token as an environment variable

`export GITHUB_TOKEN='your_token'`

2. Configure your teams in the teams.json file
3. Run the script using `python3 metrics.py`

This script makes the following assumptions

1. You're using GitHub teams to indicate who is a team member and who is an external contributor.
2. New bugs get the label `needs-triaged` to indicate the bug has not yet been reviewed by the team. Once the review has occurred, the label should be removed.
